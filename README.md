## Project Overview

GoBank is a straightforward project aimed at helping developers familiarize themselves with backend development in Go. It covers essential concepts and best practices, providing a solid foundation for further exploration in Go's ecosystem. Whether you are new to Go or looking to sharpen your skills, this project is for you.

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: The programming language for building the backend.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database used for storing user and transaction data.
- **Redis**: A caching layer to improve performance.
- **Fiber**: A web framework for building the API.
- **GraphQL**: For flexible data querying.
- **Migration Tools**: For managing database changes.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Account management
- Transaction history
- Caching with Redis
- GraphQL API for data queries
- PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- Migration scripts for database management

## Getting Started

To get started with GoBank, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tebogo01-hash/gobank.git
   cd gobank
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Go installed. You can use the following command to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:
   Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed. Create a database for GoBank and update the connection string in the `.env` file.

4. **Run migrations**:
   Use the migration tool to set up the database schema:
   ```bash
   go run migrations/migrate.go
   ```

5. **Start the server**:
   Launch the application with:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using tools like Postman or curl. Here are some example requests:

- **Register a new user**:
  ```http
  POST /api/register
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
      "username": "exampleUser",
      "password": "examplePassword"
  }
  ```

- **Get transaction history**:
  ```http
  GET /api/transactions
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ```

For a complete list of API endpoints, refer to the documentation within the codebase.
